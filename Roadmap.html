        <p>OneAction is building from the bottom up, on a shoestring, we don’t have big funders or sponsors. 
            What we do have is a vision to transform politics in New Zealand and a roadmap to get there. 
            Each stage is marked by a milestone in the TallyUp (the number of active members). 
            <br>Learn about the TallyUp <a href="{{site.data.urls.join}}"> here</a>.

                        This is ground zero where it’s all about spreading the word and growing support for OneAction’s vision

                    <p>
                        There's always going to be plenty of people who think that what we're doing is impossible - we're not looking to convince them, 
                        we're just seeking those who <i>do</i> want to cut a new path, the innovators, the early adopters, the ones who dream big
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Vision</strong> stage will run until the TallyUp reaches 25,000. No donations are accepted during this stage. 
                        Participation will just be the TallyUp and no doubt we'll start having informal get-togethers to share ideas. Join now <a href="{{site.data.urls.join}}">here.</a>

                        This is where the real work begins. In the Build stage we'll create the digital democracy platform and policy framework.
                        Members are verified to get ready for secure online participation and voting.

                        A lot of work has already been done around the world in various small projects to create some of the online tools that we'll need but make no mistake, 
                        this is poineering sutff and building our platform is going to be a huge task. The expectation is that there will be a mix of voluntry and paid work

                        The first rounds of participation will focus on setting the long-term values of the collective, and giving us an opportunity to update our constitution, should we decide to do so

                        Game On! With the support of 200,000 of New Zealands OneAction will register as an official New Zealand political party. 
                        We will make history by being the first modern party to enter parliament on our first run.

                        Yes, you read that right, OneAction is tuning politics on its head, we will only register as an official political party once we are prepared with a solid policy
                        set and have the support we need to take seats in parliament.
