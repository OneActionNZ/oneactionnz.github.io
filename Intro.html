            <p>
                Kia ora, welcome to <span class="text-oabold">OneAction Political Co-operative</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Aotearoa, the way we do politics is broken. I think it’s something most of us recognise. When we look around the world it’s not hard to see that democracy is under threat
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditional politics is focused on getting our vote, not empowering us. It aims to concentrate power in the hands of politicians, and leave us out of the picture - at least until the next election. Traditional politics creates division not unity. It revolves around short-term thinking, and views everything through a lens of political risk. It’s a broken model and it’s taken us as far as it can
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-oabold">OneAction Political Co-op</span> is a bit like a political party in that we seek seats in parliament. But we’re different in almost every other way...
            </p>
            <p>
                OneAction’s sole purpose is to give our members a voice in the decisions that shape Aotearoa
            </p>
            <p>
                Us every day kiwis need to get a bit more involved in steering this great waka Aotearoa. OneAction is all about building an easy way to do just that - at <span class="text-oabold">massive scale</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to do this by building a <span class="text-oabold">digital democracy</span> platform where our members participate in setting the views and values they want for New Zealand
            </p>
            <p>
                In general elections we rely on votes from the co-op members not the public. In a sense, we vote for ourselves. OneAction won’t register as an official NZ political party until we have 200,000 members - enough to take seats at our first election
            </p>
            <p>
                Our vision is that by 2032 OneAction will have the support of at least 500,000 New Zealanders, and that for our members, taking part in setting Aotearoa’s direction will be a fun and rewarding part of everyday life
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re at stage 1 of our plan - building support for the idea. Once we reach 25,000 members, we’ll move into the start-up stage
            </p>
            
            <p><span class="text-oabold">Do you support a better way of doing politics in Aotearoa?</span> <a href="{{site.data.urls.join}}">Click here to join us</a>. It takes <span class="text-oabold">less than 2 minutes</span> per month to support OneAction</p>
            
            <p>
                If you think it’s a good idea but do nothing, then an idea it will stay
