                <p>Kia ora Aotearoa, welcome to <span class="text-oabold">OneAction Democracy Co-operative</span>.  OneAction is embarking on the most ambitious political project in New Zealand’s recent history - <span class="text-oabold">to give you a voice in the decisions that shape Aotearoa</span> 
                <p>In a minute I’ll explain OneAction’s vision and what a Democracy Co-operative is. But If you feel like politics is already working just fine and your voice is already well represented, then this probably won’t be of interest to you.  But if you’re with me when I say, <span class="text-oabold"><i>“I love democracy, but I really hate politics”</i></span>, then keep reading because I want to share an idea to make politics work for us </p>
                <p>There are two main reasons why we need to act now to innovate and change the way we do politics</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Aotearoa New Zealand (and the world) is facing some huge challenges and they are going to get bigger. We need a way to adapt and respond to challenges faster and better
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are huge opportunities that we’re missing because we’re not working well together at the widest scale
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>To tackle these challenges, and grab these opportunities, us every day kiwis need to get a bit more involved in steering this great waka Aotearoa. OneAction is all about building an easy way to do just that - <span class="text-oabold">at massive scale</span> </p>
                <p>OneAction Democracy Co-op is a bit like a political party in that we seek seats in parliament. But we’re different in almost every other way...</p>
                <p>For example, where traditional political parties are all about getting your vote and concentrating power in the hands of party leaders and MPs, OneAction’s <span class="text-oabold">sole purpose</span> is to give our members a <span class="text-oabold">voice</span> in the conversation, thereby <span class="text-oabold">returning all political power</span> back to the co-op members.</p>
                <p>To do this we're going to build an <span class="text-oabold">online democracy platform</span> where we gather the views and values that kiwis want for Aotearoa New Zealand and use this to create policy, which the co-op then votes to accept (or not). OneAction is owned, operated, and exists for its members. Our votes in general elections come from our members</p>
                
                <p>Our vision is that by 2032 OneAction will have the support of at least 500,000 New Zealanders, and that for our members, 
                    taking part in setting New Zealand’s direction will be a fun and rewarding part of everyday life. And that grassroots political participation 
                    will become a new norm in New Zealand, with OneAction leading the charge to ultimately make New Zealand a world example of a new kind of politics for the many not the few</p>
