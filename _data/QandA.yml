      question: Is OneAction a political party?
      answer: Not yet, OneAction is building towards being a political party but will only register as a party when we have enough support to take seats in parliament. See <a href="/Roadmap/">roadmap</a> for more info

      question: Isn’t it dangerous to have everyday people making decisions about the government policy?
      answer: OneAction is building an online platform to allow kiwis to participate in setting the direction and the outcomes they want to see in Aotearoa New Zealand (“the what” and “the where”). Development of policy ("the how") will be done by experts and community leaders, using the best available evidence. We’re <strong> not</strong> embarking on a “direct democracy” project where policy decisions are made by non-experts based on their opinions. See <a href="/DigitalDemocracy/">digital democracy</a> for more info.

      question: Online democracy platform? What about security?
      answer: Building a secure and trustworthy platform for democratic participation is a huge challenge and yes security is a big concern. No system can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure, but this can’t be seen as a reason not to do something. Emerging technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">blockchain</a> which allow for tamper-proof transactions will likely be very useful, but make no mistake, it’s a huge challenge and there’s always some risk involved. It also presents and exciting opportunity for researchers and software developers to work on the cutting edge of eParticipation. Get in contact!

      question: Where are you on Social media!? You know it’s 2020 right!?
      answer: Social media platforms are private, profit-driven corporations. They have their place, but we’re doing our own thing. OneAction is 100% owned and operated by its community. We see ourselves as adjacent to social media, not contained within it. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use social media to tell your friends and whānau about us. OneAction never uses paid advertisement, we believe that our vision is big enough to carry itself by word of mouth

      question: 200,000 members before you register as a party? Isn't that a bit unrealistic?
      answer: 200,000 people is approximately 7.5% of the total voter turnout in the 2017 general election, so while it’s a big number, it’s still only just enough to get over the 5% margin to win seats in parliament. Unrealistic, perhaps, it’s certainly a lofty goal, but in my view most kiwis would like a bit more of a say in the direction of Aotearoa New Zealand. Of course, there will be plenty of people who prefer to stick to the traditional way of doing things, that’s fine, they’re not the ones we’re looking to assemble here. Are there 7.5% of us who want to try a new way of doing politics? I firmly believe so

      question: Where are your polices? What does OneAction actually do?
      answer: Because we’re starting from the ground up without big funders. We need to work through several stages to build up the organisation. The purpose of OneAction is to give our members a voice and then turn that voice into policy. Once we have 150,000 members (quorum stage) policy will be built based on input from the membership via the online digital democracy platform. See <a href="/Roadmap/">roadmap</a> for more info
