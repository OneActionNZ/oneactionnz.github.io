      question: Is OneAction a political party?
      answer: Not yet, OneAction is building towards being a political party but will only register as a party when we have enough support to take seats in parliament. See <a href="/Roadmap/">roadmap</a> for more info

      question: Isn’t it dangerous to have everyday people making decisions about the government policy?
      answer: OneAction is building an online platform to allow kiwis to participate in setting the direction and the outcomes they want to see in Aotearoa New Zealand (“the what” and “the where”). Development of policy ("the how") will be done by experts and community leaders, using the best available evidence. We’re <strong> not</strong> embarking on a “direct democracy” project where policy decisions are made by non-experts based on their opinions. See <a href="/DigitalDemocracy/">digital democracy</a> for more info.

      question: Online democracy platform? What about security?
      answer: Building a secure and trustworthy platform for democratic participation is a huge challenge and yes security is a big concern. No system can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure, but this can’t be seen as a reason not to do something. Emerging technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">blockchain</a> which allow for tamper-proof transactions will likely be very useful, but make no mistake, it’s a huge challenge and there’s always some risk involved. It also presents and exciting opportunity for researchers and software developers to work on the cutting edge of eParticipation. Get in contact!
