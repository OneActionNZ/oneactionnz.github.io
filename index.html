                <p>Kia ora Aotearoa, welcome to OneAction Political Co-operative.  OneAction is embarking on the most ambitious political project in New Zealand’s history, to give you a voice in the decisions that shape Aotearoa 
                <p>In a minute I’ll explain OneAction’s vision and what a political co-operative is. But If you feel like politics is already working just fine and your voice is already well represented, then this probably won’t be of interest to you.  But if you’re with me when I say, <i>“I love democracy, but I really hate politics”</i>, then keep reading because I want to share an idea to make politics work for us </p>
                <p>There are two main reasons why we should act now to innovate and change the way we do politics</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Aotearoa New Zealand (and the world) is facing some huge challenges and they are going to get bigger. We need a way to adapt and respond to challenges faster and better
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are huge opportunities that we’re missing because we’re not working very well together at the widest scale
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>To tackle these challenges, and grab these opportunities, us every day kiwis will need to get a bit more involved in steering this great waka Aotearoa. OneAction is all about building a way to do that</p>
                <p>OneAction Political Co-op is a bit like a political party in that we seek seats in parliament. But we’re different in almost every other way. Our purpose is to facilitate a wide scale conversation and to be a conduit between our members and political power</p>
                <p>We aim to do this by building an online platform where we can gather the views of what kiwis want for Aotearoa New Zealand and use those to create policy which the co-op votes to accept (or not). OneAction is owned, operated, and exists for its members. Our votes in general elections come from our members and we don’t wait for an election to count our numbers</p>
                
                <p>Our vision is that by 2032 OneAction will have the support of at least 500,000 New Zealanders, and that for our members, 
                    taking part in setting New Zealand’s direction will be a fun and rewarding part of everyday life. And that grassroots political participation 
                    will become a new norm in New Zealand, with OneAction leading the charge to ultimately make New Zealand a world example of a new kind of politics for the many not the few</p>
                <p>If that sounds like a good idea to you, please consider signing up, because this will only work once a very large number of us get involved, at least a tiny bit. It takes less than 2 minutes per month of your time to support OneAction. Look around, ask questions, and <a href="{{site.data.urls.join}}">click here if you want to join us</a>.
