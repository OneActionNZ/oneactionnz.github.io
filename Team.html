                        I’m in the process of developing the ideas and building a team. It's still very early days yet but I wanted to get this site up as a place to start gathering and sharing info. 
                        You can get in contact through the following email address. <a href="mailto:info@team.oneaction.nz?Subject=oneaction.nz" target="_top">info@team.oneaction.nz</a>

                        My background is in technology architecture and project management, and I’m currently studying politics at Massey university. I conceived OneAction after being involved with The Opportunities Party leading up to, and beyond, the 2017 general election. I was inspired by the potential of some of TOP's policies but eventually came to the view that there’s really no lack of good ideas out there, but rather a lack of political will. In my view, us everyday kiwis aren’t taking responsibility for the direction of our country, nor do we have a way to take responsibility. OneAction is my response, a way to innovate and transform the way we do politics, and to give everyday people a real voice in the decisions that shape Aotearoa New Zealand.
