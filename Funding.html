            <p class="lead">OneAction is a grassroots, people-powered organisation. This is how we deal with money and transparency:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Membership is free
              </li>
              <li>
                We don’t have big donors or external influencers. <b>No fat cats!</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                OneAction is funded by monthly micro-donations from our memebers
              </li>
              <li>
                There is no minimum donation (mebership is free), but there is a <b>maximum</b> monthly donation limit. This means one member can't donate significantly more than another, so growing funding relies on growing the membership
              </li>
              <li>
                OneAction provides transparency of every dollar in and every dollar out and you can view this online <i>(work is in progress on this)</i>
              </li>
              <li>
                We will only start accepting donations once we reach <a href="{{site.data.urls.roadmap}}">Stage 2</a> (TallyUp 25k)
              </li>
              <li>
                We don’t spend money on public advertising. Our advertsing is by word-of-mouth. Our members are part-owners of the co-op, it's up to them to grow the membership<i> - We will however spend money on print material to help our members share the vision </i>
              </li>
