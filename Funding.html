            <p class="lead">OneAction is a grassroots, people-powered organisation. This is how we deal with money and transparency:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>We don’t have big donors or external influencers</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Membership is free</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Individual members can donate up to a maximum monthly limit. This means one member can't donate significantly more than another. Growing funding relies on <a href="/Join/">growing the membership.</a></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>OneAction provides total transparency of every dollar in and every dollar out and you can view this online <!--<a href="/Ledger/">here</a><p>-->
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> Contributions will only open once we reach <a href="{{site.data.urls.roadmap}}">Stage 1</a> (TallyUp 25k)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We don’t spend money on public advertising. Our advertsing is by word of mouth.<br>
                  (We will spend money on print material to help our members share the vision)</p>
