<p>First post - might as well get right down to business. OneAction is an idea for a new way of ‘doing politics’ in Aotearoa New Zealand. In the first stage of building OneAction, the ‘vision’ stage, we are testing the waters to see how many people would get onboard with the idea, Basically, we’re looking for expressions of interest. TallyUp is how we measure that interest. Once we get to 25,000 members it will be clear we have an idea worth pursuing and we'll move to the next stage of the <a href="{{site.data.urls.roadmap}}">roadmap</a></p>

<p>It’s hard to know how long it will take, but eventually politics will be transformed by digital tech. OneAction aims to be at the forefront of that transformation and if you read our <a href="{{site.data.urls.constitution}}">constitution</a>, I hope you’ll agree that it provides a solid foundation for a political cooperative that works to deliver for the public good of all New Zealanders, in an effort to continue growing Aotearoa’s roots of egalitarianism</p>

<p>OneAction is focused 100% on our members and amplifying their voice, in contrast traditional parties are focused on getting your vote. These are two very different perspectives. </p>

<p>Traditional parties only count their numbers once every 3 years. OneAction counts our numbers every month. This is the purpose of TallyUp</p>
<p>Would you like to join OneAction and help start building a new kind of politics?</p>

<p>It really is a case of take it or leave it, an offer to take joint ownership in this political cooperative, it might not be for you, no worries, thanks for stopping by</p>
