I"<p>Kia ora folks, this is a heavy topic but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s one weâ€™ve all given at least some thought to lately, and I donâ€™t feel that itâ€™s been fairly canvased by the media.  But not addressing it and sweeping it under the carpet would be to let each other down. By each other I mean us people of Aotearoa New Zealand â€“ because we are all part of this community and weâ€™re all responsible for it.</p>
