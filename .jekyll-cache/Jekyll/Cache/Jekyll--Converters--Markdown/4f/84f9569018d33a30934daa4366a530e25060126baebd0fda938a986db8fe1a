I"¡<p>In thinking about the recent policy announcements aimed at addressing our housing issues, which have been decades in the making â€“ I wondered, what other issues are just below the surface gradually building momentum but still at a level we can go on ignoring them. Then I wondered, what if a very large number of Kiwiâ€™s got a bit more deliberate about addressing these issues. What if we used technology in new ways to build consensus on tackling some of the big issues <em>before</em> they came to bite us? Further, imagine if we used that same technology to find agreement on ways to accelerate our progress as a country, as a group of people working together.</p>
