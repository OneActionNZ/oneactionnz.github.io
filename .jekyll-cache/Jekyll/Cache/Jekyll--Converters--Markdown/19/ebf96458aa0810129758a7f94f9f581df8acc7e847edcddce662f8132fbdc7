I"#<p>While you’re at your place in lockdown, it’s a great time to think about your place in Aotearoa New Zealand. We tend to think a lot about our place in the home, at work, in clubs and in the community. But we don’t tend to think so much about our place in steering this ship Aotearoa New Zealand. After all, it’s <strong>our</strong> ship, <strong>our</strong> waka. No matter who you are, you have something to contribute to the conversation – and the conversation needs you – it needs you to listen, and it needs you to speak.</p>
