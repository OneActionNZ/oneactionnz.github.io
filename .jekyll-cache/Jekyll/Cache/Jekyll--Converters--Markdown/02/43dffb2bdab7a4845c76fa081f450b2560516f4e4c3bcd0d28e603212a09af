I"⁄<p>Kia ora folks,</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about the purpose of political parties. What <em>should</em> a political party look like, what <em>should</em> it do? Given that democracy is all about the will of the people and the kind of community we want, the best answer I can give is that the <em>primary</em> purpose of a political party is to connect people to political decisions.</p>

<p>In reading over the constitutions of our 15 presently registered political parties it‚Äôs interesting to note that none of them state empowing New Zealanders as their main goal.</p>

<p>This is the OneAction purpose statement (<a href="/Downloads/OneAction - Constitution v2.3a - Published.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="gtag('event', 'Click', {  'event_category' : 'PDF Download',  'event_label' : 'Constitution'});">OneAction Constitution</a>):</p>

<p style="color: #C25000; font-size: 120%; text-align: center;"><em>‚ÄúOneAction is a member-driven political organisation which, through participatory processes, exists to give its members a voice in the decisions which shape Aotearoa New Zealand, and to enact that voice by being elected to parliament by its members.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>OneAction proposes a new model for a political party which looks unlike any other party we have today. OneAction exists entirely to give everyday New Zealanders a real connection to the decisions that shape our country. OneAction looks to facilitate conversations across different viewpoints, ideologies, and cultures. OneAction looks to get us politically-match-fit so we can face big issues.</p>

<p>NgƒÅ mihi rƒÅ <br />
