I"÷<p>Folks, I keep rabbiting on about a <em>‚Äúdifferent way to do politics‚Äù</em>, but what would it actually look like?  How is it different from what we do now? Is it even worth building? Over the next few posts, I‚Äôll look at some key differences between a traditional political party and a democracy co-operative. In this first post I look at who carries the load ‚Äì who owns the decisions and the direction of our awesome wee country? And why does it matter?</p>
