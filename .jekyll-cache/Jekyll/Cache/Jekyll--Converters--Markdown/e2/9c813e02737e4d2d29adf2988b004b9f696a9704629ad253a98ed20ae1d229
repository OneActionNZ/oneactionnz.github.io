I"Q<p>Kia ora folks,
In this series of posts, I’m hoping to explain how a Democracy Co-op like OneAction is fundamentally different to a traditional political party and why it’s worth building. In the last post I showed that in a Democracy Co-op, decisions are collectively made and collectively owned, whereas in traditional parties all responsibility rests on the shoulders of politicians, leading to finger pointing and a whole lot of spin, instead of open honest dialog. In this post I look at where political parties focus their energy and question the value they bring to citizens.</p>
