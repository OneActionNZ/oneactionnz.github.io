I":<p>Earlier this month we saw farmer-protesters from Groundswell and climate-change-protesters from Extinction Rebellion shouting at each other in the streets. I’m all for people making their voices heard on the issues they care about, and protest is a valid way to do that, but is this really the best we can do? Shouting at each other in the street? Unfortunately, it seems that the current way we do politics is pretty limited and traditional political parties actually thrive on this kind of division and conflict, so they’re quite happy with the status quo.</p>
