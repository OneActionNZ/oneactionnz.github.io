I"Ý<p>The 2020 US election and subsequent events have shown us just how low to the ground a democratic country can fly without totally crashing and burning. Culturally Aotearoa is a bit different from the US so we canâ€™t expect issues with our democracy to be expressed in the same way, and Iâ€™m not suggesting that New Zealand is as far off the track as the US is, but there is without a doubt rot in our democracy as there is in many western democracies across the world.</p>
