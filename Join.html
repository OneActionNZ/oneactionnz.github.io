                    <p><strong>TallyUp™</strong> is the cornerstone of OneAction. It’s the way you join OneAction and maintain your membership. This is the minimum participation, the minimum <strong>one action</strong> required to be a member. It takes less than 2 minutes a month. The effort is almost nothing, but it’s a deliberate action and that’s what counts. You could think of it as a regular micro-donation of your willpower 
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        The concept is simple. To join OneAction, send an email with the subject <strong>join</strong> to <a href="mailto:tallyup@oneaction.nz?subject=join">tallyup@oneaction.nz</a> - just a blank email. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The email subject is important, it helps us block spam, so you need make sure you have the word <strong>'join'</strong> in the subject line
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        At the end of every month, OneAction sends an email to all our members with the current TallyUp – that is, the total number of active members. <strong>Now for the most important part</strong> - If you still want to be a member of OneAction and want to be counted in the next month’s TallyUp – simply reply to the email. It’s as simple as hitting 'Reply' then 'Send'
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you don’t renew your membership, you’ll receive no further updates, but you can always re-join at any time
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So rather than a membership fee, we have a membership action, that is, to check-in each month via email. And each month you’ll be able to see how we’re growing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a member of OneAction you’re a part-owner of OneAction, we don’t spend money on advertising, we rely on word of mouth, so if you want to see it grow, share it with your friends and whānau

                        Q: Why use email, isn’t that a bit oldschool?<br>
                        A: Yeah it is and that's kinda the idea, email is the most universal and accessible form of internet communication. It’s also cheap to set up and run which is required to start OneAction on a shoestring (i.e. no fat cat donors!)
